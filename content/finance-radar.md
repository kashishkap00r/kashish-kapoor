FinanceRadar is a small internal tool I built for myself.

I wanted a way to track financial and business news for my job @ Zerodha without:
- doomscrolling
- duplicate headlines
- low-signal content

So I vibe-coded a system that pulls from 50+ credible sources, cleans the feed, and throws out what should actually matter.

## What it does (in plain terms)

- aggregates news from curated, high-quality sources
- removes repetition and obvious noise (read: stock price movement)
- helps me scan, prioritize, and decide what’s worth deeper work

It’s not a product.  
It’s a **workflow tool** — built to make idea generation for my writings (slightly) faster and (a lot) calmer.

*This is an evolving tool. I keep it deliberately simple.*
