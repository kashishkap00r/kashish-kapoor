Personal finance is more personal, than finance.  

You don’t need more “financial literacy”. You need a simple structure that fits *your* life — and the push to actually act on it.

That's why I do 1:1 sessions with early–mid career professionals (salaried or freelance) who want clarity and momentum with money.

## The real problem

Most people aren’t stuck because they don’t know the basics. It's because they know a bit too much and are overwhelmed, with all the _gyaan_ out there.
This makes the decisions messy, and the action gets delayed.

What I bring is not secret knowledge.  

I bring **structure**, **simplicity**, and a bias towards **doing the next right thing**.

## How this works in 120 minutes

**1) We map your life to your money**  
Income, expenses, goals, responsibilities, timelines — the full picture in a custom & personal notion template.

**2) We identify the gaps**  
Find where are we lacking withing the 6 pillars of personal finance.

**3) We turn it into action**  
Small moves, clearly sequenced over 2-4 weeks, so you stop overthinking and start executing.

The goal is simple: **you should be able to run this without me**.

## The 6 pillars we work through

### 1) Income
Income is the engine. If money doesn’t come in, there's no plan.

### 2) Savings
It doesn’t matter how much you earn if it all leaks out.  
We build a simple spending plan, budgeting that doesn’t suck, and automations.

### 3) Insurance + emergency planning
This is the “don’t get wiped out” pillar.  
Emergency fund + the right insurances, based on your life (not generic advice).

### 4) Debt management
Existing loans or future loans — both matter.  
We optimize repayment, interest cost, and decision-making without confusion or guilt.

### 5) Investments (goal-based)
The most important of all pillars.  
We set the right asset allocation for new money and clean up the existing portfolio based on goals identified.

### 6) Taxes 
We make decisions with after-tax reality in mind and keep things compliant.

## This is for you if…

- you want a **system**, not tips
- you want things explained in **simple language**
- you’re willing (but too lazy) to take **action** (even small action)
- you want to understand your own decisions — not outsource them forever

## This is not for you if…

- you want someone to manage your money for you
- you want trading calls / stock tips
- you want guarantees

---

## Quick note (compliance, in plain English)

This is **not investment advisory**. I’m **not SEBI registered**.  
I’m not a stock tips service, not an MFD, and I don’t sell financial products.

This is 1:1 help to bring structure and clarity to your personal finances — **you make the final calls**.
