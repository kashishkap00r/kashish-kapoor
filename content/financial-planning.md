Personal finance is personal.  
You don’t need more “financial literacy”. You need a simple structure that fits *your* life — and the push to actually act on it.

I do 1:1 sessions with early–mid career professionals (salaried or freelance) who want clarity and momentum with money.

## The real problem

Most people aren’t stuck because they don’t know the basics.  
They’re stuck because money is tied to goals, family, fear, habits, and a million trade-offs — so decisions become messy, and action gets delayed.

What I bring is not secret knowledge.  
I bring **structure**, **simplicity**, and a bias towards **doing the next right thing**.

## How this works

**1) We map your life to your money**  
Income, expenses, goals, responsibilities, timelines — the full picture.

**2) We build your personal system**  
A plan that feels realistic, not “ideal on paper”.

**3) We turn it into action**  
Small moves, clearly sequenced, so you stop overthinking and start executing.

The goal is simple: **you should be able to run this without me**.

## The 6 pillars we work through

### 1) Income
Income is the engine. If money doesn’t come in, planning is theory.  
We focus on stability, growth, and how to make your income more predictable.

### 2) Savings
It doesn’t matter how much you earn if it all leaks out.  
We build a simple spending plan, budgeting that doesn’t suck, and automations.

### 3) Insurance + emergency planning
This is the “don’t get wiped out” pillar.  
Emergency fund + the right insurances, based on your life (not generic advice).

### 4) Debt management
Existing loans or future loans — both matter.  
We optimize repayment, interest cost, and decision-making without confusion or guilt.

### 5) Investments (goal-based)
Investing is not a hobby — it’s a tool for goals.  
We set the right asset allocation for new money and clean up the existing portfolio.

### 6) Taxes
No drama, no last-minute panic.  
We make decisions with after-tax reality in mind and keep things compliant.

## This is for you if…

- you want a **system**, not tips
- you want things explained in **simple language**
- you’re willing to take **action** (even small action)

- you want trading calls / stock tips
- you want guarantees

## Quick note (compliance, in plain English)

This is **not investment advisory**. I’m **not SEBI registered**.  
I’m not a stock tips service, not an MFD, and I don’t sell financial products.

This is 1:1 help to bring structure and clarity to your personal finances — **you make the final calls**.
