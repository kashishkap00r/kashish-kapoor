# Hey, I’m Kashish.

I work at **Zerodha** in **Bangalore**.  
I write about money, markets, and how to think clearly — and I’m pretty into **fitness** (cricket, runs, gym… the usual damage).

## If you want 1:1 help with money

I do a small amount of **1:1 money help** — very practical, very action-oriented.

## Small side project

I built a lightweight news dashboard called **FinanceRadar** for my own research workflow.
