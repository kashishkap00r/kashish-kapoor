## Where I write

Most of my writing is here:

- **The Daily Brief (Zerodha)** → [read it](https://thedailybrief.zerodha.com/)
- **The Chatter (Zerodha)** → [read it](https://thechatterbyzerodha.substack.com/)

(Yes, my `/writings` page is a bit outdated right now.)

## If you want 1:1 help with money

I do a small amount of **1:1 money help** — very practical, very action-oriented.

[See what that looks like →](/financial-planning/)

## Small side project

I built a lightweight news dashboard called **FinanceRadar** for my own research workflow.
