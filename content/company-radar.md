[CompanyRadar](https://companyradar.kashishkapoor.com) is a side project I built to make company-level reading from long-form market content much easier.

The core idea is simple: instead of reading edition by edition, I wanted to read company by company.

---

## What it does

CompanyRadar turns The Chatter archive into company-centric pages by:

- scraping historical editions
- extracting company mentions and quote blocks
- mapping quotes to companies
- building a chronological timeline for each company (oldest to newest)

---

## Why I built it

Most content streams are time-first.  
Research is usually entity-first.

If I am tracking one company, I want one clean place to see what has been said about it over time.

## Current output

It runs as a static site and is designed to stay lightweight, searchable, and easy to scan.
