[CompanyRadar](https://companyradar.kashishkapoor.com) is a side project I built to make company-level reading from our long-form market content much easier.

---

## What it does

Our team at Markets by Zerodha publishes a lot of company-focused work across [The Daily Brief](https://thedailybrief.zerodha.com/) and [The Chatter](https://thechatterbyzerodha.substack.com/).

CompanyRadar organizes this work into company-centric pages by:

- scraping historical editions
- extracting company mentions and quote blocks
- mapping quotes to companies
- building a chronological timeline for each company (newest to oldest)

---

## Why I built it

For company-wide analysis done by our team, I needed one place where all insights are grouped by company instead of scattered across editions.

So I built CompanyRadar.

## Current output

It runs as a static site and is designed to stay lightweight, searchable, and easy to scan.
