<p>Our primal ancestors were fierce cave dwellers, engaging in body-slamming brawls over food, mates, status, and territory.<br><br>It was their everyday drudgery, an instinctive part of their existence.<br><br>But fast forward to the 21st century, and we find ourselves in a world of modern science and convenience, where we no more have to fight over resources.<br><br>But that doesn't mean we should not embrace our primal instinct.<br><br>The excessive comfort coma of being hooked on the Netflix drug and sugar-loaded ice cream tubs has made us a generation of weaklings who can’t and won’t fight.</p>

<p><br>I was a meek and timid guy with no aggression. I was fit from playing sports, but when it came to standing up to bullies, I would often shy away.<br><br>I avoided confrontation like a plague, the sign of a frail masculine move.<br><br>Why would you run away from a confrontation that you know is a looming certainty to make a stand for yourself?<br><br>So I decided to step up and learn how to fight, even if I knew I might never have to use those combat skills in a physical altercation.<br><br>The mere belief in my capabilities and that I could do something itself sparked the confidence in me to confront with gusto.</p>

<p>This is the ultimate confidence booster.<br><br>But it's not just about physical confrontations.<br><br>The confidence I gained from fighting spilled over into all areas of my life.<br><br>I found myself being more assertive, less of a pushover.

<p><br>Take any sport for that matter, it makes you mentally tough.<br><br><a href=""https://kashishkapoor.com/blog/from-ordinary-to-extraordinary-how-to-forge-mental-toughness-like-goggins/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Mental toughness</a> is all about doing the stuff that puts you in discomfort. Having control over your mind in such fabricated situations makes it easier for you to go through them in real life like a breeze.<br><br>Just like physical conditioning, mental conditioning takes time and effort. You gotta progressively overload that brain of yours. Push it to the brink of voluntary discomfort, squeeze that last rep in, and then go a little further.</p>

<p>You gotta prep your mind for taking a hit, a real rib-breaking gut-punch that could knock the wind out of you. And that takes some serious mental fortitude.<br><br>Sure, putting yourself in harm's way might sound crazy, but at least you have control over the intensity and duration of discomfort.<br><br>It's a different story when you step into the ring with an opponent who is trying to land a naptime knockdown blow.<br><br>In that moment, you surrender yourself to the situation.<br><br>You're ready for whatever comes your way, whether it's an unstoppable iron fist to the jaw or a lightning-fast shin to your knee.<br><br>And that's what makes you truly tough.</p>
