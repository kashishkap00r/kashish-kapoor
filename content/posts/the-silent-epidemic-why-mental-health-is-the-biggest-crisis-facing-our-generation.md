<p>As he sits alone in his small, dimly-lit apartment, surrounded by the deafening silence and feeling the weight of loneliness, he can't help but wonder if this is all there is to life. <br><br>He wakes up every morning to a job he despises, with colleagues who don't understand him, and no romantic partner to share his life with. <br><br>His high school friends, with whom he once shared everything, are now distant memories that only live on in his social media feed. <br><br>Even his parents, who live in a distant city, seem too far away to help him with his struggles. <br><br>It's a scenario that many young adults find themselves in today, and unfortunately, for some, it can lead to a dangerous path of mental depression and even suicide. <br><br>No doubt, suicide is the <a href=""https://www.uclahealth.org/news/suicide-rate-highest-among-teens-and-young-adults"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">second-leading cause of death</a> among people aged 15 to 24. <br><br>But it was not always like this, so what happened? Why is this generation suffering?</p>

<p>Every generation has a fair share of struggles. Our parents’ struggles were different from ours. <br><br>Back in the day, they faced extreme hardship in making ends meet. Finding a job at the age of 23 or 24 was considered a feat. <br><br>However, things have changed drastically, and we are witnessing a new era where even <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/profile/ryan-kaji/?sh=2066f9fc6f3c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">6-year-old YouTubers</a> are rolling in the dough. <br><br>Broadly speaking too, our generation is overall much financially well off than baby boomers or gen X.<br><br>While it came as a surprise to my parents that I landed myself a well-paying job in finance right out of undergrad (not that they doubted me :P), only I could see my competition bagging even higher packages.<br>       <br>But this doesn't mean shit.<br><br>We may be witnessing <a href=""https://kashishkapoor.com/blog/category/financial-health/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">coin-clinking success</a> but are <a href=""https://kashishkapoor.com/blog/category/mental-health/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">mentally in a meltdown</a>. </p>

<p>We first have to accept that we are mentally unhealthy and then come with terms to the fact that social media is hazardous to our health.<br><br>All that is now left is eliminating it from our lives - which (I won't lie) is very difficult to act on!<br><br>Even if you are not addicited to the habit of mindless scrolling your TikToks, IG Reels or YT Shorts, you would still internally climb a mountain of resistance to uninstall the app because of social pressure. <br><br>Social media is like the clingy friend who won't take a hint and constantly demands your attention. You may feel like you're held hostage by the pressure to keep up your online facade, all while trying to avoid being labeled as a digital hermit.<br><br>I too had such thoughts.<br><br>But let me tell you, it was all in my noggin!<br><br>When I nuked my Instagram account, I was sweating bullets about losing touch with my squad.<br><br>However, much to my surprise, my inner circle found a way to slide into my DMs on WhatsApp, even if they never had my digits before. <br><br>Their efforts to stay connected were a testament to our bond, and it became clear that these were the ride-or-die homies I needed in my life. <br><br>It was like a filter, separating the real ones from the meme-sharing phonies.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, take care of your mind like you take care of your phone: charge it daily (meditation), remove unnecessary apps (social media), and don't be afraid to restart it when (seek therapy) needed. <br><br>Remember, mental health is not a luxury, it's a necessity.</p>
