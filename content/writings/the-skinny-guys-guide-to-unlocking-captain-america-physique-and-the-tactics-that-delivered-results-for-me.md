<p>As I strolled along the road, little did I know that a surprising encounter awaited me.<br><br>Spotting my friend across the bustling street at the <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/photos/delhi-university-north-campus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">university campus</a>, I was taken aback.<br><br>We had planned to meet tomorrow, but <em>fate</em> had different ideas.<br><br>It had been a staggering 16 months since we last saw each other in person, since our <em>prank-filled exploits</em> and <em>adrenaline-fueled</em> late-night drives.<br><br>This friend of mine held a <strong>special place</strong> in my life, but little did I realize that this meeting would mark the beginning of a <em>transformative journey</em>, as he became more than just a friend.<br><br>In fact, he would become a catalyst, a <strong>well-wisher</strong> who would ignite the <em>dormant spark</em> of self-improvement within me.<br><br>As we drew closer, I observed a <em>whirlwind</em> of emotions sweep across his face. <strong>Surprise</strong> swiftly morphed into <strong>concern</strong> and even a hint of <strong>disgust</strong>.<br><br>The first words that escaped his lips cut deep</p>

<p>Translating loosely to, "What happened to you? You've become so skinny."<br><br>This remark struck me harder than any physical blow.<br><br>Meeting for the first time after the long-drawn battle with COVID, he could effortlessly observe the <em>drastic weight loss</em> I had experienced. I had withered away to the point where I resembled a mere stick figure.<br><br>The contrast between us was <strong>stark</strong>.<br><br>While he had dedicated himself to boxing and hitting the gym during the pandemic, I had allowed myself to dwindle. Despite our similar body structures before the pandemic, he was titanically muscular now.<br><br>This moment served as a <strong>resounding wake-up call</strong>. It was high time for me to take charge, to embark on a journey of self-transformation that would reverse the tides and reshape my physique.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, I felt not only physically frail but also <strong>unattractive</strong>.
