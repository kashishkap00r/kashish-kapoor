<p>As I strolled along the road, little did I know that a surprising encounter awaited me.<br><br>Spotting my friend across the bustling street at the <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/photos/delhi-university-north-campus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">university campus</a>, I was taken aback.<br><br>We had planned to meet tomorrow, but <em>fate</em> had different ideas.<br><br>It had been a staggering 16 months since we last saw each other in person, since our <em>prank-filled exploits</em> and <em>adrenaline-fueled</em> late-night drives.<br><br>This friend of mine held a <strong>special place</strong> in my life, but little did I realize that this meeting would mark the beginning of a <em>transformative journey</em>, as he became more than just a friend.<br><br>In fact, he would become a catalyst, a <strong>well-wisher</strong> who would ignite the <em>dormant spark</em> of self-improvement within me.<br><br>As we drew closer, I observed a <em>whirlwind</em> of emotions sweep across his face. <strong>Surprise</strong> swiftly morphed into <strong>concern</strong> and even a hint of <strong>disgust</strong>.<br><br>The first words that escaped his lips cut deep</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p><em><strong>"Kya sukh gaya hai be tu?"</strong></em></p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Translating loosely to, "What happened to you? You've become so skinny."<br><br>This remark struck me harder than any physical blow.<br><br>Meeting for the first time after the long-drawn battle with COVID, he could effortlessly observe the <em>drastic weight loss</em> I had experienced. I had withered away to the point where I resembled a mere stick figure.<br><br>The contrast between us was <strong>stark</strong>.<br><br>While he had dedicated himself to boxing and hitting the gym during the pandemic, I had allowed myself to dwindle. Despite our similar body structures before the pandemic, he was titanically muscular now.<br><br>This moment served as a <strong>resounding wake-up call</strong>. It was high time for me to take charge, to embark on a journey of self-transformation that would reverse the tides and reshape my physique.</p>

<p>The upheaval caused by COVID turned our lives topsy-turvy, leaving no stone unturned.<br><br>While I had always prided myself on being <em>athletically inclined</em>, having even represented my state in <strong>badminton nationals</strong>, the pandemic imposed severe limitations on my <em>exercise routines</em> and restricted my <em>meals</em> to a meagre maximum of twice a day.</p>

<p>It doesn't require a team of rocket scientists to grasp that a <strong>lack of exercise</strong> coupled with <strong>reduced caloric intake</strong> can render one weak and feeble.<br><br>To make matters worse, I found myself entangled in a web of <a href="/writings/dating-mistakes-to-avoid/#:~:text=Story%20Time!,by%20yours%20truly." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating woes</a>, battling the clutches of <a href="/writings/the-silent-epidemic-why-mental-health-is-the-biggest-crisis-facing-our-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a>.<br><br>This combination of physical and emotional setbacks threatened to transform me into the spitting image of <strong>Christian Bale</strong> from "The Machinist."</p>

<p>Without a doubt, I felt not only physically frail but also <strong>unattractive</strong>. With barely a <em>shred of visible muscle</em>, my body lacked any appealing features.<br><br>I had long lived under the <em>illusion</em> that my leanness, accompanied by those <strong>elusive six-pack abs</strong>, equated to good health.<br><br>It was only later, in a moment of <em>epiphany</em>, that I realized I wasn't lean but merely skinny.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>Lean (Healthy) != Skinny (Unhealthy)</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Those visible abs were <strong>NOT</strong> a testament to a <em>muscular abdomen</em>; rather, they were a reflection of my body's <em>absence of fat</em>.<br><br>Far from being healthy, I had been <strong>deceived</strong> by my own <em>misperceptions</em>.<br><br>However, it was that <em>piercing</em> comment from my friend that ignited a spark within me. The fact that those six words were the very first to pop into his mind struck me like a <strong>thunderbolt</strong>.<br><br>I knew I had to take action.</p>

<p>Much like the awe-inspiring transformation of <em>Steve Rogers</em>, the skinny Brooklyn kid turned into the superhuman strength and chiselled physique of <strong>Captain America</strong>, I too have discovered the secrets akin to the "Super-Soldier Serum" that propelled my own journey towards a remarkable change.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">[1] Eat until you puke</h2>

<p><br>Amidst the noise and confusion surrounding <em>nutrition</em>, let me share a simple truth: it's all about the math.<br><br>The science behind nourishment boils down to a <strong>straightforward equation</strong> that even a kindergartener could grasp.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Calorie in &gt; Calorie out: You gain weight (enter the caloric surplus)<br>Calorie out &gt; Calorie in: You lose weight (enter the caloric deficit)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-tertiary-background-color has-background">💡 Calories are units of energy found in the food we eat. When we eat, our body breaks down food into smaller components, which are then converted into energy which in turn fuels our bodily functions.</p>

<p><br>Forget the myriad of complexities people often associate with weight control.<br><br>Focus on this fundamental principle of being in a <strong>moderate caloric surplus of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking#preliminary-steps:~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20you%20need%203%2C000%20daily%20calories%20per%20day%20to%20maintain%20weight%2C%20you%20should%20aim%20to%20consume%203%2C300%E2%80%933%2C600%20instead%2C%20depending%20on%20your%20experience%20level." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300 kcal</a></strong> and supplement it with these essential factors to enhance your understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all calories are created equal. Prioritize <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/how-can-i-eat-more-nutrient-dense-foods#:~:text=That's%20where%20the%20saying%20%E2%80%9Cempty,fat%2C%20added%20sugars%20and%20sodium.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutrient-dense calories</a> over empty ones.</li>

<li>Focus on quality as much as quantity by choosing <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/junk-food-vs-healthy-food#what-are-healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole foods</a> over processed ones.</li>

<li>Steer clear of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eat-less-saturated-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saturated fats</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans fats</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simple carbs</a>, but not forgetting “<a href="https://betterhumans.pub/kale-wont-kill-you-sugar-isn-t-poison-ignore-silly-food-claims-about-harm-4c725c65dd9c#:~:text=volume%20of%20consumption.-,The%20Dosage%20Makes%20the%20Poison,-The%20next%20time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portion is poison</a>”.</li>

<li>Stay adequately hydrated by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/why-is-water-important" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinking enough water</a> throughout the day.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>But by restricting myself to a mere two meals per day, I unwittingly plunged into a destructive cycle.</p>

<p>I was inadvertently harming myself, experiencing dwindling energy levels and succumbing to lethargy. This decline in physical activity further suppressed my appetite, leading to an even more diminished food intake.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>“If you want to get big, you eat big”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>And this remains the <strong>hardest part</strong> of gyming as well.<br><br>It is not the workouts.<br><br>It is stuffing your body with the right <em>quantity</em> and <em>quality</em> of fuel to keep it running and healthy.<br><br>I would literally stuff myself till I felt like puking as I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFhyDRYwNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zyzz posing on Legend by Tevvez</a> on repeat until my food finished.<br><br>That became my ordeal for the next few months.<br><br>Another thing that helped was <strong>calorie tracking</strong> through an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFhyDRYwNk">app</a>.</p>

<p>Measuring my calories helped me know how much I was lacking behind.<br><br>This made sure that If I was targeting 3,000 calories a day and was still short by a couple hundred by the end, I needed to get that milk packet and a <a href="/writings/crackin-the-case-to-drink-or-to-eat-your-eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few eggs</a> and drink them before I could get some ZZZZ.<br><br>Let's clear up any misconceptions about my calorie-tracking obsession though.</p>

<p>Unlike the unhealthy mindset of letting numbers on an app <em>dictate my mood</em>, which many anti-calorie trackers warn against, I used it as a <strong>tool</strong> to provide much-needed guidance and direction on my nutrition journey.<br><br>And I went from 143 lbs to 165 lbs in no time.<br><br>Happy me!<br><br>Here are a few foods that became a staple in my journey:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eggs - High in protein and a good breakfast option</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YMSlvI9mCYc">Banana shake</a> - Age-old recipe to gain weight</li>

<li>Paneer - Veg-friendly alternative to egg</li>

<li>Sprouts - A powerhouse of nutrients</li>

<li>Peanut butter - A calorie-dense food with a good balance of healthy fats, protein, and carbohydrates.</li>

<li>Brown rice - Nutrient-rich whole grain providing a steady release of energy</li>

<li>Lentils - High in protein and fiber, which aids in muscle repair and digestion</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">[2] Stop running, immediately</h2>

<p><br>In my quest for a <em>healthier</em> and more <em>muscular</em> physique, I mistakenly opted for <strong>running</strong> as my primary form of exercise.<br><br>Little did I know that I was <em>undermining</em> my own progress by neglecting the power of resistance training.</p>

<p>Consider the difference between <strong>sprinters</strong> and <strong>long-distance runners</strong>. The former, with their explosive power and well-defined muscles, embody the results I was seeking.<br><br>It became clear that my preference for galloping 5 kilometers every day across <a href="https://greatruns.com/new-delhi-bonta-park/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favourite park</a> back in Delhi Campus, accompanied by minimal bodyweight exercises, was <strong>NOT aligning</strong> with my goals.<br><br>Why was resistance training so important for me, you ask?<br><br>Unlike <strong>running</strong>, which primarily improves <em>cardiovascular endurance</em>, <strong>resistance training</strong> stimulates <em>muscle growth</em> and <em>development</em>. It enables progressive overload, where the muscles are consistently challenged with increased resistance, leading to <em>hypertrophy</em> and <em>strength gains</em>.<br><br>Even when I started prioritizing <em>resistance training</em>, I stuck with <strong>bodyweight exercises</strong> and couldn’t have been more wrong.<br><br>While exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, and squats are excellent compound movements, they have limitations in terms of <strong>progressive overload</strong> and targeting <strong>specific muscle groups</strong>.<br><br>There's only so much you can do in terms of repetitions within a set. To build muscle effectively, <strong>progressive overloading</strong> is crucial.<br><br>And it requires providing stimulation that your muscles haven't grown accustomed to.<br><br>Despite being proficient in push-ups, pull-ups, and squats due to my background as a skater, gymnast, and badminton player, I could perform <em>50 push-ups</em> in a single go, yet still not achieve significant muscular hypertrophy.<br><br>It was only when I finally made the decision to join a gym (last month) that I witnessed astounding results.</p>

<p>As a beginner, my muscles responded rapidly to the new regimen. I could visibly observe my chest, back, and shoulder muscles growing within a matter of weeks, accompanied by prominent veins—a <em>testament</em> to the effectiveness of <strong>proper stimulation</strong> and <strong>progressive overload</strong>.<br><br>Running still has its place in my routine as a warm-up activity, but it no longer takes center stage in my workouts.<br><br>I learned two valuable lessons from this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The gym isn't just for weight loss; it's essential for sculpting our bodies and avoiding an unhealthy appearance, even if we realize it later than we'd like.</li>

<li>Aligning actions with goals is crucial. No matter the effort, if actions don't align with goals, results will be lacking. I should have realized sooner that muscle building required a different approach than running, and adjusted my workout regimen accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Words</h2>

<p><br>In conclusion, building a remarkable physique akin to Captain America's requires a strong foundation built on the <em>fundamental pillars</em> of nutrition, exercise, and rest. To embark on this transformative journey, I urge you to embrace the following steps consciously:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nutrition</a>:
<ul>
<li>Consume a caloric surplus to support muscle growth.</li>

<li>Opt for clean, nutrient-dense foods with a focus on protein.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a>:
<ul>
<li>Prioritize resistance training over excessive cardio.</li>

<li>Continuously challenge your muscles through progressive overload.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Rest:
<ul>
<li>Allow your body to recover adequately, including getting a good night's sleep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Having made significant progress in my own journey, I am now shifting my focus to <strong>body recomposition</strong> as my fitness goal, from bulking.</p>

<p>Maintaining a healthy weight of <em>165 lbs</em> for my <em>5'11"</em> frame, I aim to replace body fat with lean muscle mass.</p>

<p>By adopting a state of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a27583488/how-to-lose-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high energy flux</a>, I strive to achieve this desired transformation.</p>

<p>So far the journey has been nothing short of life-changing and I am even more excited about what lies ahead.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed and focus locked!</p>
