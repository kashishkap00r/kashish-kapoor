<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>BUT, they forget that when you are writing for yourself is different from when you are writing for others.</p></blockquote></figure>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">[1] Write in haste, edit with grace</h4>

<p><br>I take pride in being a <em><strong>perfectionist</strong></em> - as if it is something to be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180219-toxic-perfectionism-is-on-the-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proud of</a>.<br><br>You'll find me <em>hunched</em> over my keyboard, lost in the <em>pursuit</em> of the <strong>perfect paragraph</strong>.<br><br>It's like a <strong>compulsion</strong> to obsess over every <em>word</em>, every <em>punctuation mark</em> until it's absolutely flawless.<br><br>I'll spend hours tweaking and refining that first paragraph until it's just right <strong>before I even consider</strong> moving on to the next one.<br><br>But hey, at least I'm thorough, right? - <strong>NO</strong></p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>How was it affecting my writing:</strong></h6>

<ul>
<li>I was not allowing my creative flow to fully paint itself on the canvas but obstructing it incessantly with the critique of my editing mind.</li>

<li>While my fellow creators sprinted ahead, I trudged, taking me longer to produce a piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was losing my <em>writing mojo</em>, stifled by my own perfectionism. I couldn't let my thoughts run <strong>wild and free</strong>, instead obsessing over every punctuation mark.<br><br>The result? A <em>creative constipation</em> that left me <strong>staring at my screen</strong> like a deer caught in headlights, unable to get into that <em>sweet state of flow</em>.<br><br>Not an ideal way to write.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>What did I do?</strong></h6>

<ul>
<li>Write now, edit later</li>

<li>Spill my thoughts on the keyboard without a second thought</li>

<li>And then meticulously edit at a snail’s pace</li>
</ul>

<p>Picture this: you're <em>Eminem in "Rap God"</em> spilling words faster than a <em>leaky faucet</em>. When you let your creative side run free, you're in the zone where the <em>words flow like lava from a volcano</em>.<br><br>But if you interrupt that flow with a <strong>critical eye</strong>, you might as well be trying to drive with the parking brake on. That's where the magic of separating writing and editing comes in.<br><br>By waiting a day or two to edit your work, you'll get a <strong>fresh perspective</strong> that you just can't achieve when you're too close to the piece.<br><br>Plus, you'll be able to bask in the glory of your creative peak, unencumbered by the <em>judgmental voice</em> of your inner editor.<br><br>Writing fast can make you feel like a wizard, but the result can also be a messy and confusing potion.<br><br>It’s like someone turned off the “autocorrect” button in your brain.<br><br>The <strong>unedited raw version</strong> will be far from what your audience <em>deserves</em>.<br><br>This is where editing comes in - taking the time to refine and polish your work until it sparkles like a diamond.<br><br>It's like sculpting a statue: you start with a rough block of marble, but through careful and deliberate chiselling, you end up with a masterpiece.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>Editing is the chisel, and your words are the marble.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The end result is what the readers will adore.<br><br>But, how to perfect your writing through editing is that you ask? The following two hacks will help!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">[2] Visual wordsmithing</h4>

<p><br>We, humans, are <em><strong>visually wired creatures</strong></em>.<br><br>70% of our <a href="https://simply.science/index.php/human-eye/8723-humans-are-visual-creatures#:~:text=but%20it%20may%20surprise%20you%20to%20know%20that%20the%20eye%20contains%2070%25%20of%20all%20the%20sensory%20receptors%20in%20the%20human%20body.%20The%20function%20of%20all%20photoreceptors%2C%20the%20rods%20and%20cones%2C%20is%20to%20respond%20to%20light%20with%20neural%20messages%20that%20are%20sent%20to%20the%20brain%2C%20where%20they%20are%20translated%20into%20images%20of%20our%20surroundings." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sensory receptors</a> reside in our eyes!<br><br>That's why, to make your writing stand out, you need to make it as <em>visually stunning</em> as <strong>Northern Lights</strong>.</p>

<p><br>Of the <em>two</em>, the <strong>latter</strong> is definitely more captivating to read.<br><br>Just like how a <em>deliciously cooked meal</em> looks more tempting than a <em>plain plate of food</em>, the appearance of your writing can <strong>make or break</strong> its appeal.<br><br>Even if the information presented is the <strong>exact same</strong>, a visually stunning piece is more likely to capture and hold the reader's attention, leaving them with a more <em>satisfying experience</em>.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><br>H<strong>ow do you make your writing visually stunning?</strong></h6>

<p>By breaking free from the monotony of plain words and opt for exciting ways to present your ideas. Here are a few tips to get you started:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add pull-quotes and blockquote - Highlight your <strong>most relevant</strong> material to catch the reader's eye</li>

<li>Use multimedia - A picture is worth a thousand words, and it can also boost your <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/08/24/why-your-seo-strategy-should-include-multimedia-content/?sh=18a3fa851fa7">SEO game</a></li>

<li>Use numbers list - Break a paragraph down into <em>easy-to-digest points</em></li>

<li>Keep sentences short and crisp with no paragraphs - No one wants to read a 300-word single paragraph</li>

<li>Keep enough white space - Give your words some <em>breathing room</em> to let them shine</li>

<li>[BONUS] Use italics and bold - Make your <strong>keywords pop</strong> and help readers <em>skim</em> through your article</li>
</ol>

<p>Your readers owe you nothing. If they have voluntarily decided to click on your article and read it, give them value not only through your unique insights but also by presenting them in a visually stunning and captivating manner.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">[3] Show, don't tell</h4>

<p><br>It's a classic writing technique that many <em>novelists</em> use that I started only <strong>recently</strong>.<br><br>Imagine the power of words that paint vivid <em>mental images</em>, evoking <em>emotions</em> and immersing your audience in the <em>world</em> you create. Instead of spoon-feeding them information, you're inviting them on a <strong>thrilling journey of discovery</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The difference between show and tell is that show invokes on the reader a mental image of the scene/emotion, while tell is a statement of an action/emotion.</p>
<cite><a href="https://writingcooperative.com/my-golden-rules-to-show-dont-tell-f4d030eca8c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britanny Levy</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>When you tell, you’re stealing to the readers the opportunity of discovering, by themselves, the world you created, to add something personal to the scene — for them to get involved.<br><br><em><strong>Instead of saying:</strong></em> Junk food is bad for health<br><em><strong>Say:</strong></em> Grease-dripping fries and mouth-watering ice cream cakes are disease-inducing poison for your body<br><br>It is fascinating how a simple shift from telling to showing can make your message more <strong>convincing</strong> and <strong>engaging</strong>.<br><br>Well - <em>Show don’t tell</em>&nbsp;is easy to, theoretically, understand. However, it can be complex to apply it.<br><br>Up until now!<br><br>I've got a <em>prompt</em> engineered to make it a breeze. It's one of my carefully curated secrets to effortlessly infuse my writing with the power of show, don't tell.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-tertiary-background-color has-background">Following is the example of words that I use to make my content witty, engaging, captive and descriptive

Junk Food: Grease-dripping fries and mouth-watering ice cream cakes
Enemy: Arch Nemesis
Excess sun exposure: Tan yourself to a crisp
Muscle soreness: Body-bending muscle meltdown

Give me such words for the following term-

[word]:</pre>

<p>You can fine-tune it to make your prompt response more accurate with the tone you expect, but it has given good results to me so far<br><br>Here’s an example -</p>
