## Physical &amp; Financial Health 💪 💰

#### <strong>Most supplements are superfluous - both in Diet and Finance!</strong>

It wouldn’t be a normal day on earth if you don’t see your favourite influencers selling their voice to the brand making the&nbsp;highest bid.

Perhaps your treasured&nbsp;<strong><em>fitness influencer</em></strong>&nbsp;is pitching the latest “supercharged brain boosters” for ultimate mental clarity.

Or your beloved&nbsp;<em><strong>financial influencer</strong></em>&nbsp;is endorsing “guaranteed fixed returns” on Crypto FDs (a playful jab we all know who :))

The fact is that consumers&nbsp;don’t need everything in the market, but companies keep churning out new products for hefty profits.

Don’t blame them. Blame yourself!

For 99% of your financial needs, consider this:

<ul>
<li>3 high-quality equity mutual funds for growing wealth</li>

<li>1 ELSS for saving on taxes</li>

<li>1 emergency fund in an FD</li>

<li>1 term insurance plan and 1 health insurance plan</li>

<li>1 credit card to establish a credit score</li>
</ul>

On the flip side, here’s what you can skip:

<ul>
<li>Crypto Tokens</li>

<li>Subscriptions for intraday stock tips or FnO strategies</li>

<li>Endowment Plans/ULIPs</li>

<li>Sectoral Mutual Funds</li>

<li>P2P lending products</li>
</ul>

Similar principles apply to your diet.

My fitness-conscious friend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeramitrareddy1207/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neeramitra</a>&nbsp;suggests focusing on these supplements:

<ul>
<li>Caffeine (or simple black coffee)</li>

<li>Whey protein (only if your diet can’t give you enough protein)</li>

<li>Creatine (stop if you have hair fall)</li>

<li>Nootropics like Ashwagandha, Tongkat Ali, and ZMA (Again, highly optional)</li>
</ul>

While keeping a safe distance from absolute waste supplements like-

<ul>
<li>Mass gainers</li>

<li>Fat-Burner Pills</li>

<li>Pre-workouts</li>

<li>BCAAs</li>

<li>Any other fancy-sounding shit</li>
</ul>

Although our guidance is on point, exceptions exist.

Everyone’s financial and dietary plans can’t be identical.

While built on these core truths, your unique needs shape your plan.

So, before delving into unconventional or trendy options, consult your financial planner or nutritionist for personalized advice.

## Mental Health 🧠

#### New Book Recommendation

I have long held 'The Almanac Of Naval Ravikant' in high regard as a guide for self-discovery and personal growth.

The book is a compilation of pearls of wisdom that Naval has dropped in podcasts and talks throughout his career.

It is packaged well in an easy-to-consume format for anybody who wants to explore topics of wealth and happiness.

However, my current favourite book has surpassed even that esteemed title.

> **Image unavailable (failed to import during WP migration)**

"The Way of the Superior Man" by David Deida is a profound and transformative work that I believe should be required reading for all who seek to live a fulfilling and purposeful life.

Leaving the contents of this masterpiece aside, which in itself is worth immense praise, it is Deida's writing style that stands out amidst the crowd.

It is both poetic and practical, making complex ideas accessible and relatable.

Despite the title suggesting, this book is not just for men.

It is for everyone who wishes to understand the true nature of&nbsp;masculine and feminine energy, and how to navigate the dance between the two in order to cultivate more fulfilling relationships, both personally and professionally.​

The way David puts across the point of masculine energy embracing the feminine of the woman and the world, unleashes a flood of new perspectives that you could have never imagined.

And the ironic part is, even though I have completed this book multiple times, I always learn newer things each time I read it as if it's a completely new book.

It's as if the book itself is a living, breathing entity, constantly evolving and revealing new secrets with each passing day.

This book is not a light weekend read but a heavyweight champ that requires some serious mental muscle to tackle.

This is the kind of book that you'll want to savor like a fine wine, sipping slowly and savoring every last drop.

I have been meaning to write a blog on this, but feel like an imposter trying to summarize it, knowing that I have merely scratched the surface.

One day I might give summarizing it a try though.
