<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Most supplements are superfluous - both in Diet and Finance!</strong></h4>

<p>It wouldn’t be a normal day on earth if you don’t see your favourite influencers selling their voice to the brand making the&nbsp;highest bid.</p>

<p>Perhaps your treasured&nbsp;<strong><em>fitness influencer</em></strong>&nbsp;is pitching the latest “supercharged brain boosters” for ultimate mental clarity.</p>

<p>Or your beloved&nbsp;<em><strong>financial influencer</strong></em>&nbsp;is endorsing “guaranteed fixed returns” on Crypto FDs (a playful jab we all know who :))</p>

<p>The fact is that consumers&nbsp;don’t need everything in the market, but companies keep churning out new products for hefty profits.</p>

<p>Don’t blame them. Blame yourself!</p>

<p>For 99% of your financial needs, consider this:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 high-quality equity mutual funds for growing wealth</li>

<li>1 ELSS for saving on taxes</li>

<li>1 emergency fund in an FD</li>

<li>1 term insurance plan and 1 health insurance plan</li>

<li>1 credit card to establish a credit score</li>
</ul>

<p>On the flip side, here’s what you can skip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto Tokens</li>

<li>Subscriptions for intraday stock tips or FnO strategies</li>

<li>Endowment Plans/ULIPs</li>

<li>Sectoral Mutual Funds</li>

<li>P2P lending products</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar principles apply to your diet.</p>

<p>My fitness-conscious friend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeramitrareddy1207/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neeramitra</a>&nbsp;suggests focusing on these supplements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caffeine (or simple black coffee)</li>

<li>Whey protein (only if your diet can’t give you enough protein)</li>

<li>Creatine (stop if you have hair fall)</li>

<li>Nootropics like Ashwagandha, Tongkat Ali, and ZMA (Again, highly optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>While keeping a safe distance from absolute waste supplements like-</p>

<ul>
<li>Mass gainers</li>

<li>Fat-Burner Pills</li>

<li>Pre-workouts</li>

<li>BCAAs</li>

<li>Any other fancy-sounding shit</li>
</ul>

<p>Although our guidance is on point, exceptions exist.</p>

<p>Everyone’s financial and dietary plans can’t be identical.</p>

<p>While built on these core truths, your unique needs shape your plan.</p>

<p>So, before delving into unconventional or trendy options, consult your financial planner or nutritionist for personalized advice.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">New Book Recommendation</h4>

<p>I have long held 'The Almanac Of Naval Ravikant' in high regard as a guide for self-discovery and personal growth.</p>

<p>The book is a compilation of pearls of wisdom that Naval has dropped in podcasts and talks throughout his career.</p>

<p>It is packaged well in an easy-to-consume format for anybody who wants to explore topics of wealth and happiness.</p>

<p>However, my current favourite book has surpassed even that esteemed title.</p>

<p>"The Way of the Superior Man" by David Deida is a profound and transformative work that I believe should be required reading for all who seek to live a fulfilling and purposeful life.</p>

<p>Leaving the contents of this masterpiece aside, which in itself is worth immense praise, it is Deida's writing style that stands out amidst the crowd.</p>

<p>It is both poetic and practical, making complex ideas accessible and relatable.</p>

<p>Despite the title suggesting, this book is not just for men.</p>

<p>It is for everyone who wishes to understand the true nature of&nbsp;masculine and feminine energy, and how to navigate the dance between the two in order to cultivate more fulfilling relationships, both personally and professionally.​</p>

<p>The way David puts across the point of masculine energy embracing the feminine of the woman and the world, unleashes a flood of new perspectives that you could have never imagined.</p>

<p>And the ironic part is, even though I have completed this book multiple times, I always learn newer things each time I read it as if it's a completely new book.</p>

<p>It's as if the book itself is a living, breathing entity, constantly evolving and revealing new secrets with each passing day.</p>

<p>This book is not a light weekend read but a heavyweight champ that requires some serious mental muscle to tackle.</p>

<p>This is the kind of book that you'll want to savor like a fine wine, sipping slowly and savoring every last drop.</p>

<p>I have been meaning to write a blog on this, but feel like an imposter trying to summarize it, knowing that I have merely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>One day I might give summarizing it a try though.</p>
