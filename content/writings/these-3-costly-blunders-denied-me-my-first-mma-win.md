<p>In the realm of mixed martial arts, where victories are <span data-token-index="1" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">hard-fought</span> and defeats are <span data-token-index="3" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">humbling</span>, lies this indelible memory of my <span data-token-index="5" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-weight:600">first fight</span>. <br><br>My sparring mates were <span data-token-index="7" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">cheering</span> on the sidelines and adrenaline was <span data-token-index="9" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">pumping</span> through my veins like a rampant river as the referee's signal started the fight and unleashed a <span data-token-index="11" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-weight:600">surge of energy</span>. <br><br>Locked in a staredown with my opponent, I was filled with nervousness until my primal instinct kicked in as we started exchanging <span data-token-index="13" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-weight:600">blow</span> <span data-token-index="15" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-weight:600">after blow</span> in the ring.<br><br>Those three rounds, each lasting a mere two minutes, became a blur of <span data-token-index="17" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">sweat-soaked intensity</span>.<br><br>Pain throbbed in my head, my temples pulsating with every heartbeat, while my lungs desperately gasped for the sweet sustenance of air, I stood waiting for the judges to announce the result after the bout ended. <br><br>While I was glad that I didn’t end up getting KO’ed against an opponent much <span data-token-index="19" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">taller</span>, <span data-token-index="21" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">heavier</span> and more <span data-token-index="23" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-style:italic">experienced</span> than me, yet also worried about losing the fight on account of lacking technique. <br><br>My fear metamorphosed into reality as the judges score the bout 1 point in favour of my opponent. His hand was raised, and the sweet <span data-token-index="25" class="notion-enable-hover" style="font-weight:600">taste of triumph</span> eluded me.</p>

<p>Although having taken <a href="/writings/beyond-kicks-and-punches-how-martial-arts-training-can-ignite-a-remarkable-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMA as a mere hobby</a>, being the competitive guy I am, I couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed but proud of having gone the distance, leaving my mark in those gruelling six minutes. <br><br>In the aftermath, I reflected on those <em>tumultuous</em> six minutes, understanding that in the world of MMA, victory and defeat walk hand in hand. <br><br>As I dusted myself off, I vowed to return to the ring, armed with newfound wisdom learnt from the <strong>THREE MISTAKES </strong>I committed that day, for within the lessons lies the true essence of this exhilarating and unforgiving sport.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"># 1 - The Mercy Blunder</h2>

<p><br>In the midst of the intense battle, I found myself in a position of dominance. <br><br>Landing a series of <em>striking combinations</em>, I culminated with a bone-rattling uppercut that shook my opponent's jaw. <br><br>Even I couldn't help but be astounded by the <em>power</em> and <em>accuracy</em> behind my strike.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>As the referee intervened, briefly separating us, an opportunity for a <strong>TKO </strong>seemed within reach. <br><br>Yet, the fight continued, and that's when I made my first critical mistake. <br><br>With my opponent visibly <em>dazed</em> by my onslaught, I allowed <strong>complacency</strong> to seep in. <br><br>Believing victory was already assured, I started <em>pulling my punches</em>, showing mercy in a fight that seemed “destined in my favour”. <br><br>Little did I realize the consequences of this decision.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>Showing mercy in the realm of combat is ultimately a sign of disrespect towards one's opponent.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>It implies doubt in their ability to fight and undermines the <em>true essence</em> of the sport.<br><br>By holding back, I unwittingly conveyed my weakness and provided an opening for my opponent to turn the tide, which he didn’t miss.<br><br>It not only affected my momentum but planted a seed of <strong>doubt</strong> and <strong>hesitance</strong> in my mind.<br><br>Combat is a <em>dance of nature</em>, where we must let our true instincts take over the body.<br><br>But when I started filtering my actions through the lens of mercy and complacency, I started doing myself a disfavour.<br><br>In the end, the mistake of showing mercy taught me a valuable lesson—respect is earned by giving my all, fighting with every fibre of my being, and never allowing doubt or hesitation to cloud my judgment.<br><br>In the ring, true warriors embody <em>unwavering</em> intensity, leaving no room for complacency or second-guessing.<br><br>So is true for the battle of life I believe.<br><br>As and when doubt creeps in, we lose touch with ourselves and become a puppet to the mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"># 2 - The Backtrack Blunder</h2>

<p><br>During the fight, whenever my opponent managed to land a solid strike, a peculiar instinct overtook me.<br><br>Instead of standing my ground, defending with <em>tenacity</em> and taking it like a man, I inexplicably <strong>turned my back</strong> and faced the opposite direction.<br><br>Oh, how I cringe at the memory!<br><br>Rather than facing adversity head-on, I chose a path of <em>retreat</em>, hoping that by evading my opponent, I could somehow escape the assault.<br><br>In hindsight, it was a <strong>grave error</strong>, one that not only painted me as a coward but also granted my opponent a surge of confidence, giving them the chance to exploit my vulnerability.<br><br>Admittedly, as a novice entering the world of combat sports, I had <em>never</em> before experienced the sting of a <strong>strike to my face</strong>.<br><br>The shock and disorientation caught me off guard, triggering an instinctive reaction that I now view with a mix of <em>disappointment</em> and <em>self-reflection</em>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>It's a common tendency for us, comfort-loving creatures, to shy away from challenges rather than confront them head-on.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>We instinctively seek the <strong>path of least resistance</strong>, yearning for the familiar embrace of comfort and security.<br><br>However, in doing so, we fail to recognize that our true goals lie on the <strong>other side</strong> of those difficulties.<br><br>In the context of my MMA journey, victory lay beyond those <em>lightning-fast</em> crosses and <em>juggernaut</em> hooks that my opponent skillfully delivered.<br><br>As a rookie in both the world of MMA and life itself, I <em>succumbed</em> to the <strong>temptation of the backseat</strong>, inadvertently showing my opponent my vulnerability and giving up my control of the fight.<br><br>The consequence was inevitable - DEFEAT - giving me a valuable lesson:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"># 3 - The Prep Neglect Blunder</h2>

<p><br>In the weeks leading up to the fight, I must confess, my focus had shifted elsewhere.<br><br>The <em>irresistible pull</em> of the gym had captured my attention, and I found myself loving the post-lift pump after bench pressing weight.<br><br>I became addicted to this <a href="/writings/the-skinny-guys-guide-to-unlocking-captain-america-physique-and-the-tactics-that-delivered-results-for-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new fitness pursuit</a>, completely neglecting my MMA training in the process.<br><br>Though I had initially intended to strike a balance between <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/219685587/mrrqkh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building muscle</a> and maintaining flexibility, I couldn't resist the magnetic pull of the weight room.</p>

<p>Days turned into weeks without me slipping on my gloves, as I immersed myself in gruelling gym sessions.<br><br>Even a mere couple of days before the match, I pushed myself through an intense leg day, leaving my limbs <em>fatigued</em> and <em>depleted</em> (rookie mistake).<br><br>This <strong>lack of preparation</strong> combined with the <strong>exhaustion</strong> from relentless gym workouts, created the perfect recipe for defeat.<br><br>It became evident that I had not taken my impending match seriously or given it the respect it deserved.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>"It is the choices we make today that determine the regrets or triumphs we face tomorrow." - Epictetus</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>All the choices I made up until my match day were setting me up for failure.<br><br>While my thoughts were consumed with <em>excitement</em> and <em>anticipation</em> for the match, my actions betrayed a different story.<br><br>The result?<br><br>I found myself <em>gassed out</em> halfway through the <em>adrenaline-fueled</em> brawl, struggling to execute the kicks and techniques I had envisioned, burdened by the exhaustion from my gym escapades.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>By failing to prepare, I was primed for failure.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>And failure is what I did.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Words</h2>

<p><br>As it is said, the first time is always <em>special</em> and no matter the result, I will always remember this bout.<br><br>Reflecting on my journey, I realize that embracing combat sports as a hobby alongside my full-time job and side hustle has been a truly empowering decision.<br><br>It has pushed me beyond my limits, challenged me both <a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physically</a> and <a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentally</a>, and revealed facets of my character that I never knew existed.<br><br>Before we part ways, I'd like to leave you with a quote from one of my personal favourites, <a href="/writings/the-movie-that-changed-me-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Durden</a>:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>"How much can you know about yourself, if you have never been in a fight?"</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>This powerful statement encourages us to explore the depths of our own strength and resilience, urging us to step into the arena and discover the truths that lie within us.<br><br>No better way than voluntarily putting yourself in harm's way and discomfort.</p>
