Fitness is not a hobby, it's a lifestyle<br><br>It's a commitment to your health and well-being, a pledge to treat your body like the temple it is (even if it feels more like a construction site at times).<br><br>However, most people feel otherwise and view it as a mind-numbingly monotonous task that they have to drag themselves through especially when they are stuck in time-twisting, schedule-slamming frenzy.<br><br>From people trying to do push-ups in the office bathroom to sneaking in lunges while waiting in line at the grocery store, I've witnessed some pretty hilarious attempts at squeezing in exercise.<br><br>But the truth is, there are plenty of effective ways to incorporate fitness into even the busiest of schedules. So if you're ready to ditch the excuses and embrace a healthier, happier lifestyle, then let's get started!<br><br>And don't worry, I promise not to make you run a marathon before breakfast or do burpees in your cubicle (unless you're into that kind of thing)

To start with the, we have got to understand the 3 basic foundation pillars of fitness:<br>

##### <br>Nutrition:

Nutrition often gets overlooked in fitness, but it's a game-changer and can be worked into your busy life without sacrificing flavor. You can't out-train a bad diet, so don't even try! Food is the fuel for the body and your body is not a trash can, so don't fill it with garbage.<br>

##### <br>Exercise:

From maintaining cardiovascular fitness to strength training, it is the ultimate mood booster and is filled with all sorts of muscle movements to make you sweat and sore. Regardless of the buzz around its importance, most people suffer at being consistent with it long enough to see results.<br>

##### <br>Recovery:

Not a lot of people talk about it as often but it is the unsung hero of fitness! It's where the real magic happens. Without proper rest and fuel, your body can't repair and rebuild muscle tissue, which means all those gains you're working for are going to waste.<br>

Incorporating a mix of small but transformative lifestyle overhauls in the realm of nutrition, exercise, and recovery without messing up your daily routine is the insight you crave <br><br>These will include:

###### <br><strong>Walk, whenever you can</strong>

Walking is the jack-of-all-trades when it comes to health benefits! It improves cardiovascular health, lowers stress and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and boosts creativity. Plus, <a href="https://www.dummies.com/article/body-mind-spirit/physical-health-well-being/exercise-movement/running-walking/how-to-reduce-your-appetite-with-walking-143794/">studies</a> show that it actually decreases appetite, making it a double whammy for weight control. Incorporate it into your routine by taking the stairs or parking farther away. Targeting 10k steps daily is a breeze and the benefits are endless.<br>

###### <br>Switch lunch/dinner dates with workout dates

It's common to meet up with loved ones over a few cold beers or greasy slices of belly fattening pizza, but these choices can quickly derail your fitness goals. Why not switch it up with a walking date in the park or a sweat-breaking session at the nearest rock climbing gym? Making fitness a part of your social life is the ultimate lifestyle choice.

<pre>Challenge: Instead of binging on IPL nights this next couple of weeks, switch to tiring yourself out on box cricket matches with the boys. Why watch when you can play?</pre>

###### <br>Sleep, sleep, sleep

It is when the body's healing, repairing, and recharging processes occur. A good night's sleep can improve memory, creativity, immune function, mood, performance, and your T levels. Plus, it's the ultimate beauty treatment- no amount of serums and creams can replace the radiance of a well-rested face. So ditch those late-night Netflix binges and prioritize your 7-8 hour shut-eye!<br>

###### <br>Icy Cold Shower

Nothing is more relaxing than stepping out of a body awakening ice plunge with vein-engorging blood circulation, reduced inflammation and muted body-bending muscle soreness. It might sound like torture, but it’s actually a secret weapon for body recovery.<br>

###### <br>Drinking lots of water

Drinking water is like giving your body a liquid goldmine of benefits. It keeps you hydrated, helps digestion, flushes out toxins, and is the ultimate thirst quencher - plus, it's a lot cheaper than a fancy juice cleanse! Replacing water with your daily soda intake takes minimal effort, but yields enormous results.<br>

###### <br>Cut sugar and processed food

When in doubt, shave it out with Occam's razor. Sugar is a useless calorie and processed food is like a bad ex - it may be tempting at the moment, but ultimately it's just junk that'll leave you feeling regretful and unhealthy. Both are unhealthy and best replaced with nutrient-dense whole foods.<br>

###### <br>Control your portions

Portion control is not about being miserly with your food; it's about knowing how much your body actually needs. Your fitness goals should guide your actions. If you want to get lean, eat less than you burn. Keep it simple.<br>
