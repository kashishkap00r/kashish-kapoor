<p>Think of it as a <strong>sturdy base</strong> for your pyramid of wealth. Without it, your structure is going to come crashing down at the <em>slightest tremor</em>.<br><br>Sure, equity is great for long-term growth, but what happens when life throws you a <em>curveball</em>? You don't want to be forced to dip into your investment fund to cover emergency expenses.<br><br>And let's be real, just saving up for emergencies <strong>isn't enough</strong>.<br><br>If you're keeping all that cash in a low-interest bank account, not only are you losing money to inflation, but you're also way more likely to spend it on things you don't need.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A chair stands on <em>four</em> legs for stability. A tripod has only <em>three</em>, and we all know how wobbly that can be. And yet, some people rely on just <em>one source of income</em>?<br><br>Have they <strong>gone off the deep end</strong>?<br><br>Sure, you might be killing it at your job, but what happens when that one income stream dries up?<br><br><strong>Concentration risk</strong>, my friend. It's not worth it. Why not spread the love and create multiple sources of income?<br><br>Having multiple income sources not only reduces your concentration risk but also gives you the <strong>flexibility</strong> to take a <em>plunge into new possibilities</em> and try out new things.<br><br>But, if you're really into <em>monogamy with your job</em>, then at least build up that emergency fund like we talked about earlier.</p>
