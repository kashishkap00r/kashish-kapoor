#### [1] Ditch DIY stock picking

Are you an average Joe with a full-time job, personal hobbies, and a social life to keep up with?<br><br>Yet, you find yourself <strong>half-heartedly</strong> sitting in front of a computer, trying to find the next multi-bagger, all because your ‘<em>favourite influencer’</em> told you to do so.

<figure><blockquote>
While the <strong>intentions</strong> are right, <strong>execution</strong> is wrong!
</blockquote></figure>

<strong><em>Newsflash:</em></strong> You neither have the time nor the skills required to invest directly in stocks, and that's okay.<br><br>You don't need to pick stocks like a pro to become financially independent and rich.<br><br>Let's be real here. If investing in stocks were the <strong>only way to get rich</strong>, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#31fdef403d78">Forbes list</a> of billionaires would be filled with investors.<br><br>But the truth is, only <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/?list=rtb/&amp;sh=1fbe87df4639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren Buffett</a> made it to the list, and that too entering only at the age of 56.<br><br>Sure, learning about investing is essential, but trying to be the next Warren Buffett is just plain stupid.<br><br>So save yourself the trouble and let the experts handle your investments.

#### [2] Protect before profiting

As soon as first paycheque hits your bank account, you are excited to start investing in the <em>swankiest of investment schemes</em> out there.<br><br>Everybody wants to play the equity game and join the ranks of the financially savvy.<br><br>Afterall equity is a <em>profit-printing powerhouse</em> in the <strong>long run</strong> for wealth creation<br><br>That is what every finance content creator tells you. So do I.<br><br><strong>BUT</strong> the wealth creation step comes much later in the stages of <a href="https://kashishkapoor.com/financial-planning/">financial planning</a>.<br><br>Before you start building your <em>wealth empire</em>, you need to lay a <em>solid foundation</em>. And that foundation is your <strong>emergency fund</strong>.


![Embedded image](/images/writings/non-obvious-money-mistakes-that-are-costing-you-a-fortune/medium-01.jpeg)


Think of it as a <strong>sturdy base</strong> for your pyramid of wealth. Without it, your structure is going to come crashing down at the <em>slightest tremor</em>.<br><br>Sure, equity is great for long-term growth, but what happens when life throws you a <em>curveball</em>? You don't want to be forced to dip into your investment fund to cover emergency expenses.<br><br>And let's be real, just saving up for emergencies <strong>isn't enough</strong>.<br><br>If you're keeping all that cash in a low-interest bank account, not only are you losing money to inflation, but you're also way more likely to spend it on things you don't need.

<blockquote>

Having <strong>too much money</strong> in your bank account is like having a <em>bladder full of urine</em>. You can only hold it for so long before you need to release the pressure.

</blockquote>

So don't just sit on your cash, put it to work in FDs or liquid mutual funds.

#### [3] One Income? Oh, No!

A chair stands on <em>four</em> legs for stability. A tripod has only <em>three</em>, and we all know how wobbly that can be. And yet, some people rely on just <em>one source of income</em>?<br><br>Have they <strong>gone off the deep end</strong>?<br><br>Sure, you might be killing it at your job, but what happens when that one income stream dries up?<br><br><strong>Concentration risk</strong>, my friend. It's not worth it. Why not spread the love and create multiple sources of income?<br><br>Having multiple income sources not only reduces your concentration risk but also gives you the <strong>flexibility</strong> to take a <em>plunge into new possibilities</em> and try out new things.<br><br>But, if you're really into <em>monogamy with your job</em>, then at least build up that emergency fund like we talked about earlier.

<figure><blockquote>
It's better to be safe than sorry
</blockquote></figure>

You never know when the rug might be pulled out from under you, so prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

#### [4] Diversification Overdose: When More is Less

My friend excitedly told me how he had a <em>golden egg-laying goose</em> in his portfolio - a stock that went up <strong>5 times</strong> in no time.<br><br>My response? "And how much did you make out of it?"<br><br>He proudly said, "A cool ₹25k."<br><br>Now, let me tell you - this guy is <em>loaded</em>, with a portfolio as big as a house.<br><br>But get this, his allocation in that stock was <strong>only 1%</strong>!<br><br>This means, on a portfolio level, he only made a <strong>5% gain</strong>.

<figure><blockquote>
<em>Allocation hai khaas, baaki sab bakwaas</em>
</blockquote></figure>

So the question is, does it even matter?

<figure><div>

</div></figure>

What's the use of having a stock that grows 5 times if it <strong>can't make a dent in your bank account</strong>?<br><br>Even the pros, like <em>Warren Buffett</em>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/02/warren-buffett-simplifies-investing-with-a-baseball-analogy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only have a handful of winners</a> in their investment basket.<br><br>So, instead of spreading yourself thin with multiple retirement plans, mutual funds, and stocks, focus on a <strong>few well-researched assets</strong> and let them work their <em>magic over time</em>.<br><br>After all, it's not about the number of stocks in your portfolio, but the returns they bring in.

#### [5] The ultimate ROI asset that nobody talks about

<br>While everyone is busy chasing the <strong>next big crypto</strong> and obsessing over their returns, the ultimate ROI asset is right in front of you - <em>yourself</em>.<br><br>Investing in yourself is like hitting the jackpot, but nobody seems to talk about it!<br><br>Trust me, the returns are a whopping <strong>10x guaranteed</strong>!<br><br>Just imagine, investing in a course or <em>upskilling yourself</em> could result in your CTC skyrocketing to <strong>2x or even 3x</strong> what it is right now, all while giving you the option to freelance and work on your own terms.<br><br>Investing in yourself is not just about acquiring new skills, but also about <em>improving your overall well-being</em>. <br><br>Taking care of your mental and physical health can have a huge impact on your productivity, creativity, and ability to handle stress.<br><br>Hire a personal trainer, join a <a href="/writings/beyond-kicks-and-punches-how-martial-arts-training-can-ignite-a-remarkable-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combat sports</a>, or find a meditation guru to <a href="/writings/lessons-from-art-of-living-happiness-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce stress</a> and improve focus.<br><br>These investments in yourself can pay off not just in the short term, but also in the long run by reducing healthcare costs and improving your quality of life.

<figure><blockquote>
Investing in yourself is like watering a plant. You won't see the growth immediately, but over time, you'll see a thriving garden
</blockquote></figure>

All this and people will still prefer starting an SIP in a mutual fund, then investing in building their <a href="https://kashishkapoor.com/">own website</a> which can catapult their personal brand.<br><br>To err is human.

#### [6] Controlling Inflation: Not Just for Money

<br>Price inflation is the star of the show. Everyone talks about it, calculates it, and even RBI approves it. But, what about the underrated villain - <em>lifestyle inflation</em>?<br><br>It's not just the price of commodities that will inflate with time, but <strong>also your taste buds</strong>.<br><br>Sure, the cost of your favourite basmati rice may increase over time, but what about when you start craving that fancy arborio rice? Or when Netflix and chill turn into <em>4k ultra HD</em> with surround sound?<br><br>The truth is, as we age, our wants turn into needs and our needs become more and more expensive.

<figure><blockquote>
Today's luxuries become tomorrow's necessities.
</blockquote></figure>

As time passes, the bar of your expectations is set higher, and you start to adapt to the luxurious lifestyle.<br><br>So next time you're planning your finances, remember to add a few extra percentage points for those fancy dinners and expensive supplements.<br><br>if you think <strong>YOUR </strong>inflation rate is only 4-6%, you are living in a <em>fool's paradise</em>. It's time to wake up and smell the <em>expensive</em> coffee!
