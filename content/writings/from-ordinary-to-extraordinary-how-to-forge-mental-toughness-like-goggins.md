###### Embrace the Suck

<br>When it comes to building mental toughness, the first rule of thumb is to "embrace the suck."<br><br>Life's not always a bed of roses, and challenges have a knack for showing up unannounced.<br><br>But instead of running for cover, face them head-on like a warrior.

<figure><blockquote>
Shift your mindset from seeing challenges as stumbling blocks to viewing them as stepping stones for growth.
</blockquote></figure>

The harder the challenge, the more badass you'll become.<br><br>You will start witnessing the changes in your confidence from day one when you start taking on the discomfort of picking a new project at work or facing your fears.<br><br>These situations can trigger the release of adrenaline and cortisol, which are commonly known as stress hormones.<br><br>They help us to be alert, focused, and prepared to take action when faced with challenges.<br><br>It's like having your own built-in cheerleaders, urging you to "embrace the suck" and push through the discomfort. <br><br>Your body is in on the game too, with all its functions geared up to support you in your quest for mental toughness. So, what's stopping you now?

###### Develop a Code of Discipline

<br>Forge a code of discipline that you live by, and watch your mental toughness soar to new heights.<br><br>Set clear standards for yourself and make them non-negotiable.<br><br>Act as if somebody is watching a documentary of your life.<br><br>Whether it's smashing your fitness goals, slaying it at work, or conquering your relationships, refuse to settle for anything less than excellence.

<blockquote>

Motivation is temporary, discipline is permanent.

</blockquote>

But how do you stick to your code, even when you feel like hitting the snooze button or throwing in the towel?<br><br>You create a killer daily routine that's packed with habits that will level up your mental game.<br><br>Small habits make up your routine, routine keeps you disciplined and discipline takes your places.

###### Embody Extreme Ownership

<br>It's time to channel your inner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jocko Willink</a> and "own it all."<br><br>It takes courage and grit to be the captain of your own ship, and steer it towards success!

<blockquote>

The more you take ownership of your life, the more you shape your destiny.

<cite>Seneca</cite></blockquote>

You must confront and acknowledge the truth that all your actions today, will alter the course of your future.<br><br>What you do to amass as much wealth today will decide how soon will you be able to retire your parents or provide for your progeny in future.<br><br>Take a step towards mastering your destiny by visualizing your future self.<br><br>Paint a vivid picture of your future self, down to the last detail. See yourself living that dream life, and watch as it becomes easier to make it a reality through extreme ownership.<br><br>You are the author of your own story. Write it with intention, own it with courage, and create the life you want to live.

###### Develop Unstoppable Self-Belief

<br>David Goggins' mantra is "Can't Hurt Me," and it all starts with believing in yourself.<br><br>You've got to cultivate unshakable self-belief that you're a force to be reckoned with, capable of achieving anything you set your mind to.<br><br>No task big enough, no girl hot enough, no weight heavy enough, no opponent tough enough for a force like you to be reckoned with.<br><br>And self-talk is like your secret weapon, the reminders you give yourself to stay assured that you've got this. <br><br>It's the calm and collected mantra you repeat to keep your cool, or the adrenaline-pumping chant you use to fire yourself up.<br><br>Use self-talk to build that self-belief and others will follow your suit.

###### Final words

<br>Shadowing with unyielding persistence this blueprint for badassery can set you on the right path - but just like physical toughness, mental toughness comes with repeating acts of discomfort and resistance to build that strength.<br><br>Just like lifting heavy weight force your physical muscles to grow, you can start with these small acts as a practice of mental toughness to build ironclad resilience that can weather any storm -<br><br>&gt; Take cold showers<br>&gt; Wake up early <br>&gt; Try new physical activities - combat sports, rock climbing<br>&gt; Face fears - asking gorgeous strangers out<br>&gt; Practice self-discipline - <a href="/writings/one-habit-thirty-days-the-experiment-that-transformed-my-physical-mental-and-financial-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NoFap</a><br><br><br>Everyone would have read this quote.

<br>But I feel it is incomplete.<br><br>It should rather be -<br><br>""It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body <strong><mark>and mind</mark></strong> is capable""<br><br>For if you have tamed the wild beast of your mind, you have conquered the world within and unlocked the gateway to limitless possibilities.
