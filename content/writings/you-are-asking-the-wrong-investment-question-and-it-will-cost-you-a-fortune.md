<p>As someone who regularly helps people with their <a href="https://kashishkapoor.com/financial-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal financial planning</a>, I've come to expect the <em>same old question</em> from my mentees, a question that seems sensible from their perspective but falls short of the mark.<br><br>Let me address this once and for all, <strong>personal finance</strong> is an intricate symphony of the <strong>personal</strong> and the <strong>financial</strong>. Personal finance is, in fact, <em>more personal than finance</em> itself.<br><br>It's no wonder that even in this day and age, where we are drowning in information overload, people still find themselves making <a href="/writings/non-obvious-money-mistakes-that-are-costing-you-a-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-obvious money mistakes</a> that could cost them a fortune.<br><br>They cling to the belief that personal finance is all about <strong>crunching numbers</strong>, unaware that the real magic lies within the <em>enigmatic</em> realm of <strong>human behaviour</strong>.<br><br>Don’t take my word for it, but turn to the wisdom of <a href="https://www.morganhousel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morgan Housel</a>, the unparalleled maestro of finance writers in our generation-</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>”Personal finance is more about behaviour than it is about math. It's not what you know that matters, it's what you do.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Let those words sink in as we get ready to address the question you all have been asking wrong.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do they ask?</h2>

<p>As I delve into exchanges with individuals newly venturing into the investment wonderland, there's a recurring question that echoes through our conversations.<br><br>Their aspirations for <em>financial freedom</em> and the allure of <em>compounding</em> naturally lead them to a seemingly logical conclusion: <strong>to amass generational wealth</strong>, they must set their sights on one pivotal goal.<br><br>And so, they pose the question that often graces our initial encounters in my <a href="https://kashishkapoor.com/financial-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Money Mastery Program</a>:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>"How will you assist me in maximizing my returns?"</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>It's no surprise that many are drawn to the <em>simplicity</em> of the compounding formula:</p>

<p>They swiftly realize that in order to maximize the ultimate value, A, their focus should be on r, the <strong>rate of return</strong>.<br><br>But here's the twist: are they correctly identifying "maximization of A" as their <em>ultimate financial objective</em>?</p>

---

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is it wrong?</h2>

<p>There's often a preconceived notion firmly entrenched in the minds of new investors that the pursuit of maximizing A, the ultimate wealth accumulation, is the <em>holy grail of financial success</em>.<br><br>However, let's take a moment to unveil the truth:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>This assumption doesn't always align with reality</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Allow me to clarify, so there's no confusion. I understand the allure of witnessing our investments soar, with the net worth numbers on our screens climbing ever higher.<br><br>The satisfaction of monetary success is undeniable, and the desire to accumulate wealth can be addictive.<br><br>Yet, it's <strong>crucial</strong> to recognize that this obsession with "maximizing wealth" represents only a <em>fraction</em> of the <strong>true essence</strong> and significance of financial planning.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>It's akin to seeing just a solitary leaf while ignoring the vast, flourishing forest.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>It's time to shift our perspective, look beyond the <em>narrow confines</em> of wealth accumulation and uncover the greater purpose that underlies the act of financial planning.</p>

---

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should they ask instead?</h2>

<p>When it comes to financial planning, it's essential to shift our focus from the pursuit of maximizing returns to a more <strong>holistic approach</strong> that encompasses our overall <a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial well-being</a>.<br><br>Consider this: What if we reframed our perspective and asked -</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="font-size:30px"><blockquote><p>"How can I achieve financial health?"</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>This question opens up a world of possibilities, allowing us to explore a range of <em>financial goals</em>, which include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wealth accumulation (obviously!)</li>

<li>Dream Vacation Abroad</li>

<li>Higher Studies</li>

<li>Luxurious Car</li>

<li>A roof above your head</li>

<li>Financially supporting your family</li>
</ul>

<p><br>You get the gist.<br><br>Each goal brings its own set of <em>intricacies</em>, <em>time horizons</em>, and <em>sensitivities</em>.</p>

<p>Acknowledging this <strong>complexity</strong>, it becomes evident that the notion of achieving all these aspirations by merely maximizing returns is <em>naive at best</em>.<br><br>Financial planning requires a <strong>nuanced approach</strong> that considers your <em>specific goals</em>, <em>risk tolerance</em>, <em>timeframes</em>, and <em>personal circumstances</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Case in Point: Aligning Investments with Specific Goals</h2>

<p>Imagine you have set your sights on <em>pursuing higher studies</em> that require a substantial corpus of <strong>$100,000</strong> within the next <strong>15 months</strong>.<br><br>This represents a <em>short-term goal</em> with <em>minimal flexibility</em> and a <em>high degree of sensitivity</em> to your life situation.<br><br>In this scenario, the stakes are <strong>undeniably high</strong>, and there is <strong>little room for error</strong> when it comes to managing the funds earmarked for this goal.<br><br>If you were to adopt a <em>rigid mindset</em> solely focused on <strong>maximizing returns</strong> in the time frame (15 months), you might be tempted to invest in assets that appear lucrative at first glance—cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or microcap stocks.<br><br>However, such investments <strong>may not align</strong> with the <em>liquidity</em> and <em>capital protection</em> standards necessary for your specific goal.<br><br>You simply can not <em><strong>risk your college education</strong></em> in the hands of <em>digital tokens</em> and <em>penny-sized companies</em> that can easily fall prey to market manipulation mayhem.<br><br>It becomes clear that adopting a <em>one-dimensional perspective</em> of return maximization would lead you astray in this situation.<br><br>Instead, a <strong>prudent approach</strong> would be to seek out investments that may not offer the highest returns but are optimally suited to help you achieve your goal effectively, a balanced mix of fixed-income securities let's say.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Words</h2>

<p>It is of utmost importance to internalize the profound nature of personal finance as a <em>deeply personal</em> and <em>intimate</em> journey towards achieving our <strong>financial aspirations</strong>.<br><br>Each goal is <em>unique</em> - so must be it’s solution!<br><br>Achieving them will not be possible if you approach it from a <em>monochromatic mentality</em> of solely increasing your returns.<br><br>The sooner you understand it, the better it is for your <em>fiscal fitness</em>.<br><br>By understanding and embracing the complexities of personal finance, we empower ourselves to make informed decisions, paving the way towards fortified finance.</p>
