As he sits alone in his small, dimly-lit apartment, surrounded by the deafening silence and feeling the weight of loneliness, he can't help but wonder if this is all there is to life. <br><br>He wakes up every morning to a job he despises, with colleagues who don't understand him, and no romantic partner to share his life with. <br><br>His high school friends, with whom he once shared everything, are now distant memories that only live on in his social media feed. <br><br>Even his parents, who live in a distant city, seem too far away to help him with his struggles. <br><br>It's a scenario that many young adults find themselves in today, and unfortunately, for some, it can lead to a dangerous path of mental depression and even suicide. <br><br>No doubt, suicide is the <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/suicide-rate-highest-among-teens-and-young-adults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-leading cause of death</a> among people aged 15 to 24. <br><br>But it was not always like this, so what happened? Why is this generation suffering?

Every generation has a fair share of struggles. Our parents’ struggles were different from ours. <br><br>Back in the day, they faced extreme hardship in making ends meet. Finding a job at the age of 23 or 24 was considered a feat. <br><br>However, things have changed drastically, and we are witnessing a new era where even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ryan-kaji/?sh=2066f9fc6f3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6-year-old YouTubers</a> are rolling in the dough. <br><br>Broadly speaking too, our generation is overall much financially well off than baby boomers or gen X.<br><br>While it came as a surprise to my parents that I landed myself a well-paying job in finance right out of undergrad (not that they doubted me :P), only I could see my competition bagging even higher packages.<br>       <br>But this doesn't mean shit.<br><br>We may be witnessing <a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coin-clinking success</a> but are <a href="/writings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentally in a meltdown</a>.

And there is only one thing to blame - SOCIAL MEDIA

###### The root of all evils

<br>As much as I stand to benefit from this fortune-finding playground, social media is sucking the life out of every young adult out there who is not using it correctly.

<figure><blockquote>
Social media may have connected us to the world, but it disconnected us from ourselves, leaving us with more likes and less love.
</blockquote></figure>

The reason it is able to successfully f*ck us up, is the same we all love it. Connectivity.<br><br>It connects you with people half way across the world.<br><br>Now that I put on my thinking cap, I believe we were better off living in our own bubble of a world, where all that mattered to us was things and people in our vicinity.<br><br>This hyper connected world is a dreamplace for a self-absorbed egoist who can gather all the eyeballs he wants on him.

<blockquote>

Comparison&nbsp;is the&nbsp;thief of joy.

<br>Scrolling through endless feeds of perfectly edited images of botox filled models and debt fuelled extravagent lifestyles can leave us feeling inadequate and unfulfilled.<br><br>It is not just Instagram, but even LinkedIn is filled with misleading office ninjas.

We forget that social media is a highlight reel, and what we see isn't always the full story.<br><br>But nobody cares and everybody is laboring to one-up the other.<br><br>Vanity at its peak.<br><br>The constant pressure to be perfect, to have the perfect life, is taking a toll on everyone's mental health. <br><br>We are living in a world where FOMO is real, and everyone's trying to keep up with the Patels.<br><br>Not only this, but social media also remains a leading cause of loniless among masses.<br><br>Despite the illusion of being constantly connected, people may still feel isolated and disconnected from real-life relationships.<br><br>This is a reason that it is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201410/10-surprising-facts-about-loneliness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believed</a> that over 40% of us will feel the aching pangs of&nbsp;loneliness&nbsp;at some point in our lives.<br><br>In fact, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people who spent more than two hours per day on social media were twice as likely to feel lonely than those who spent less than half an hour.

###### We need to act now!

<br>The solution to any problem is simple.

<figure><blockquote>
Accept the problem -&gt; Identify the root cause -&gt; Eliminate it
</blockquote></figure>

We first have to accept that we are mentally unhealthy and then come with terms to the fact that social media is hazardous to our health.<br><br>All that is now left is eliminating it from our lives - which (I won't lie) is very difficult to act on!<br><br>Even if you are not addicited to the habit of mindless scrolling your TikToks, IG Reels or YT Shorts, you would still internally climb a mountain of resistance to uninstall the app because of social pressure. <br><br>Social media is like the clingy friend who won't take a hint and constantly demands your attention. You may feel like you're held hostage by the pressure to keep up your online facade, all while trying to avoid being labeled as a digital hermit.<br><br>I too had such thoughts.<br><br>But let me tell you, it was all in my noggin!<br><br>When I nuked my Instagram account, I was sweating bullets about losing touch with my squad.<br><br>However, much to my surprise, my inner circle found a way to slide into my DMs on WhatsApp, even if they never had my digits before. <br><br>Their efforts to stay connected were a testament to our bond, and it became clear that these were the ride-or-die homies I needed in my life. <br><br>It was like a filter, separating the real ones from the meme-sharing phonies.

In a nutshell, take care of your mind like you take care of your phone: charge it daily (meditation), remove unnecessary apps (social media), and don't be afraid to restart it when (seek therapy) needed. <br><br>Remember, mental health is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
