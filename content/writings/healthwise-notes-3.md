<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>My New Fitness Goal</strong></h4>

<p>We all start with the end in mind. That helps us achieve where we want to be.</p>

<p>When we figure out what’s missing between where we are and where we want to be, we can take action.</p>

<p>Three years ago, I was too skinny with a BMI of just 18. I wanted to be healthy and not underweight.</p>

<p>With the end goal in mind, I stuck with the course of action of&nbsp;<strong>bulking</strong>&nbsp;where I was in a caloric surplus to increase my weight.</p>

<p>Now I stand at 23.1 BMI.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’ve made good progress towards my goal.</p>

<p>At first, using things like BMI made sense when I was starting out.</p>

<p>But now, I see myself as more experienced in my fitness journey. This means I need more nuanced goals and advanced ways to reach them.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve set a new fitness goal: Body Recomposition.</p>

<p>Body recomposition is the process of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparentlabs.com/blogs/all/what-is-body-composition-how-to-calculate-body-fat-percentage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improving body composition</a>.</p>

<p>And to keep it simple, the definition of body composition is the proportion of muscle, bone, fat, and water in a person’s body.</p>

<p>This means I don’t want to focus on a target weight anymore. Instead, I want to stay around my current weight while making my body better.</p>

<p><strong>Why would I want that?</strong></p>

<p>I want to have more&nbsp;<strong>muscle</strong>&nbsp;and less&nbsp;<strong>fat</strong>. Here’s why:</p>

<p>More muscle means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Higher metabolism</li>

<li>More strength and better performance</li>

<li>Longer life</li>
</ul>

<p>Less Fat means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better cardiovascular health</li>

<li>Hormonal balance</li>

<li>Better sleep quality</li>

<li>Reduced Chronic Disease Risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus, it just makes my body look better and more attractive – who wouldn’t want that?</p>

<p><strong>How am I going to go about it?</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically, building muscle while losing body fat shouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p>Anabolic processes like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparentlabs.com/blogs/all/what-is-hypertrophy-how-protein-builds-muscle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle hypertrophy</a>&nbsp;require a surplus of energy (calories), whereas catabolic processes like burning body fat necessitate an energy deficit.</p>

<p>You can’t have excess calories&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a deficiency of calories **at any given moment.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to do things a bit differently:</p>

<p>High Energy Flux Diet + Progressive Overload Excercise</p>

<p>Higher energy flux diet = We stay in caloric balance (neither surplus or deficit) over a period of time (weekly average and not daily)</p>

<p>Progressively overload = We continue to exercise harder to keep giving our muscles the stimulus to keep growing.</p>

<p>My friend talked about it in detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-build-muscle-and-lose-fat-at-the-same-time-a-detailed-analysis-4d57b056e638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>That’s what I’m going to focus on from now on.</p>

<p>Even though there’s no specific weight target, I’m confident that as these changes take effect, I’ll feel and witness the results on my body.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Financial Health 💰</h1>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stock investment isn’t always risky, MF investment isn’t always conservative</strong></h4>

<p>When money talk crops up with my peers, I often find myself at the center of good-natured jokes about my investment choices. Let me give you a peek into this, so you’re in on the humor too.</p>

<p>I’ve been immersed in equity research since day one of my career, dedicating a hefty chunk of my time and resources to master this field.</p>

<p>I’ve even conducted an&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gfyypl5v12MV3mRJnuAHIlDz1aWTR_3AE0SkPscLqxo/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investing masterclass</a>&nbsp;on the banking sector, sharing my insights with fellow peers on how to approach investing in banks.</p>

<p>As you might expect, this led to the assumption that I’m a stellar stock picker. While there could be some truth to that, here’s the twist – all my equity allocation is routed through mutual funds.</p>

<p>A few quarters back, I made a pivotal choice that raised eyebrows among my peers – I sold all my individual stocks and moved everything into mutual funds. You can catch the details in my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7036269155213328384/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>

<p>And this is where the good-natured teasing began.</p>

<p>The core argument they present is that I’m being “too conservative” for my “young age” by opting for mutual funds. They advocate for “more risk” through “direct stock investment.”</p>

<p>Let’s clear the air.</p>

<p>Risk, in my view, is the potential for permanent capital loss in investments. Assuming both my friends and I conduct meticulous research, aiming to choose stocks and mutual funds that minimize this possibility.</p>

<p>However, the real game-changer isn’t just the selection; it’s the allocation.</p>

<p>Because remember this:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Allocation hai khaas, baaki sab bakwaas”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my friends make direct stock choices and appear audacious with their investments, their allocation in each individual stock doesn’t exceed 1% of their net worth.</p>

<p>Here’s the kicker – despite their rowdy appearances, they’re actually taking less risk than me, who’s placed their entire net worth in three mutual fund schemes.</p>

<p>Mathematically, even if my bold friends make a wrong call, the effect on the overall portfolio is minor.</p>

<p>But if I stumble with any of my mutual fund picks, the financial repercussions could be substantial.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme, allocation reigns supreme.</p>

<p>You might have diverse stock portfolios, covering F&amp;O, short-term trading, long-term investing – that’s all great. But if these choices don’t substantially impact your portfolio, my friend, you might be more conservative than you think.</p>

<p>And believe me, my returns are not subpar as well when it comes to my portfolio.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my Return on Time Invested (RoTI) is impressive in such cases. I’m not chained to my screen, obsessively tracking positions weekly.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re a stock picker who ties their net worth to a handful of stocks, you’ve got my respect.</p>

<p>Your audacious approach carries considerable financial risk, which, if backed by a solid process, can lead to substantial rewards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beating Anxiety: Simple Ways to Stay Calm</strong></h4>

<p>The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” – John Milton</p>

<p>It’s true, we often find ourselves struggling more within our minds than in reality.</p>

<p>Our minds have a powerful impact on our perceptions.</p>

<p>Anxiety can strike at any moment, draining our energy and holding us back from taking action.</p>

<p>Sometimes, our minds can be our own worst enemies.</p>

<p>Here are some strategies I use to break free from this cycle of negativity:</p>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Go for a run</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing gives me more pleasure than sweating my worries away.</p>

<p>The movement itself is liberating because it takes you out of the environment that is suffocating you.</p>

<p>It only gets better when you step out in nature. You only feel more present.</p>

<p>​ </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Switch off my phone</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Often my feelings are triggered by everything that I am consuming on my phone.</p>

<p>It can be that random teenager flexing the latest Ferrari that he bought for his parents on LinkedIn or OF girls posting obscene on IG reels/YT shorts.</p>

<p>Taking a break from screens can prevent triggering those feelings and give you a chance to disconnect.</p>

<p>​ </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Connect with friends/family</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Busy schedules always keep us distant from our loved ones.</p>

<p>Physical farness only makes things worse.</p>

<p>Talking to them not only gives you a reason to connect with them and tell them that you remember them but also takes your mind off the anxious state you were in the first place</p>

<p>​ </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deep work</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you get anxious because you are staying idle and letting your mind wander.</p>

<p>An idle mind is the devil’s workshop.</p>

<p>Once you put it to use, you witness a shift in your mood and feelings almost automatically.</p>

<p>It can be your side hustle, hobby or work.</p>

<p>Put it to work and tell your mind what to do, than letting it dictate the same to you.</p>

<p>​ </p>

<p>These things work most of the time for me. But there are times when there is no going back from the state of depressive trance.</p>

<p>That’s when I finally use my&nbsp;<em>brahmastra -</em>&nbsp;Meditation/Sleep.</p>

<p>This is when I surrender to the feeling - relax and let emotions be.</p>

<p>If I do not bore myself to sleep, I often find myself in a meditative stage where I become equanimous to things.</p>
