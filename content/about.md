  <p class="about-lede"><strong>Finance geek. Experimenter. Sporty human.</strong></p>
  <p>I am Kashish Kapoor, <strong>Business Analyst (Content &amp; Education)</strong> @ <a href="https://zerodha.com/">Zerodha</a>, based in <strong>Bangalore</strong> (hometown: Ambala).</p>
  <p>My work sits at the intersection of <strong>finance, content, and systems</strong>. I like taking messy ideas, testing them in the real world, and turning them into something useful.</p>

## What I care about

Most people optimize random things. I try to optimize the fundamentals.

<div class="about-health-pills">
  <span>Financial health</span>
  <span>Physical health</span>
  <span>Mental health</span>
</div>

Everything else is noise if these three are broken.

## What I am building right now

- Better thinking systems around money and decision-making
- Deeper finance frameworks while preparing for CFA
- Marathon endurance, one run at a time
- More biking and staying aggressively sporty (cricket still has my heart)
